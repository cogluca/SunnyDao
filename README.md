# Sunny Dao

## **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**

### Introduction

You're looking at SunnyDao! Don't stare too much as you might burn your eyes! Jokes aside
I've been working out of curiosity on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, DAO to see what the next type
of organizational model is all about.

In short, SunnyDAO is composed of three main parts:

1. A treasury, under the form of of a Smart Contract, you can see the address of this one
on Etherscan Testnet at [Voting contract on for Sunny Dao](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xC322426C8b86Ce75eBE8BC8631923ae3cBa5070A)

2. Of course the users, who need to claim a membership token, you can check the one for Sunny Dao on OpenSea at [Open Sea Testnet reference to Sunny Dao](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/sunnydao-membership)

3. And a currency, to carry internal matters through voting [Sunny DAO Token on Etherscan Testnet](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xC322426C8b86Ce75eBE8BC8631923ae3cBa5070A#code) 


### Soon

- Refactoring to modularize code
- Front end beautification for both the login flow and the membership dashboard
- Public Deployment on Netlify-Vercel-Heroku for DAO Exploration purposes
